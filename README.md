## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate **PQC**, **RSA**, and **Hybrid (RSA + PQC)** certificates using the **OQS provider** with a custom OpenSSL build.  
It also shows how to import these certificates into browsers and verify PQC algorithm support.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**
   - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ‚Üí Points to the local liboqs installation.  
   - `OPENSSL_MODULES` ‚Üí Points to the directory containing `oqsprovider.so`.

2. **Custom OpenSSL Invocation**
   - Uses `$INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl` (OQS-enabled build).  
   - Supports PQC key generation using the OQS provider.

3. **Certificate Generation**
   - **PQC (Kyber768)** ‚Äî via OQS provider  
   - **RSA (2048-bit)** ‚Äî via standard OpenSSL routines  
   - **Hybrid** ‚Äî combines RSA + PQC into one `.p12` file

4. **PKCS#12 Export**
   - Stores private key + certificate securely.  
   - Password-protected for browser/device installation.

You said:
I want to develop a certificate for the browser, and the certificate should do the following. It should give me the option to interact with another PC using RSA encryption, or it can give me the option to interact with the other PC using post-quantum cryptography encryption. I want to be able to install it on multiple devices, and each device that has it installed on its own browser is able to talk with the other one using the encryption techniques that I provided you, okay?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 21s
Nice ‚Äî this is a great project. Below I‚Äôll give a practical, implementation-focused plan you can follow (and copy/paste parts of) so a browser-installed certificate (and supporting PKI) will let two PCs talk to each other either with classical RSA or post-quantum algorithms (and ideally hybrid combinations). I‚Äôll cover architecture options, recommended algorithms, libraries/tools, an end-to-end workflow, installation & multi-device rollout, compatibility & UX concerns, and security notes. I also include concrete pointers to the tooling/docs you‚Äôll need to run commands or automate this.

Key high-level decisions I recommend

Use hybrid crypto in transport/authentication: combine a classical algorithm (RSA/ECDSA or X25519) with a PQC primitive (Kyber for KEM / Dilithium or FALCON/SPHINCS+ for signatures). Hybrid prevents ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù migration and protects you against future quantum attackers. (See the TLS hybrid design & migration guidance.) 
IETF
+1

Leverage existing PQC support in TLS/OpenSSL (liboqs / OQS provider) for server <-> client TLS and for certificate generation/testing. That‚Äôs the most practical path to get PQC into browsers/clients today. 
GitHub
+1

Keep X.509/PKI for browser client certs, but deliver crypto-agility by supporting hybrid key exchange in TLS and by provisioning credentials that the browser can import (PKCS#12/.p12). Browsers still use X.509 for client cert UX and PKI management. 
docs.digicert.com
+1

Plan fallback/compatibility: If a browser or OS doesn‚Äôt support PQC, fall back to classical crypto or hybrid negotiation; test across target browsers and OS versions. Browser vendors are gradually adding hybrid PQC support (e.g., Chrome experimental support for hybrid KEMs). 
thesslstore.com
+1

1) Architectures you can choose (short)
TLS client certificates + hybrid TLS key exchange (recommended)

Use TLS 1.3 with hybrid key exchange (classical KEM/ECDH + Kyber) provided by OpenSSL with OQS. Clients import a PKCS#12 client cert (private key + cert). Communication happens over TLS and will be protected by hybrid KEM. Ideal for browser-to-browser or browser‚Üíserver browser client auth. 
IETF
+1

WebAuthn / Passkeys with PQC (future / hardware or patched browser required)

WebAuthn allows multiple algorithms; some experimental projects add Dilithium/Kyber to CTAP2 authenticators and browser stacks. This is strong and user-friendly but requires changes to browser or authenticator firmware for PQC. Good long-term plan. 
GitHub
+1

Application-level PQC using WebCrypto + WASM libs

Implement your own PQC layer in JavaScript using WASM builds of liboqs (or other PQC libs). The app performs a PQC key exchange at the application layer (on top of TLS). This is flexible but you handle key management, protection and UX yourself. Useful where browser TLS cannot yet be adapted. 
Open Quantum Safe

2) Recommended algorithms (based on NIST & industry)
KEM (encryption / key exchange): CRYSTALS-Kyber (primary).

Signatures: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, FALCON, or SPHINCS+ (depending on your latency/size tradeoffs).

Hybrid approach: Combine X25519 (or RSA) + Kyber for key exchange; combine ECDSA/RSA signatures + Dilithium for signatures if needed. NIST has standardized several PQC algorithms and industry is adopting hybrids. 
csrc.nist.gov
+1

3) Practical end-to-end workflow (steps and pointers)
A ‚Äî Tooling to install on your ‚ÄúCA / server‚Äù machine (examples)
OpenSSL 3.x (with provider support)

liboqs + OQS provider (Open Quantum Safe) to enable PQC algorithms in OpenSSL. See the OQS provider repo + tutorials. 
GitHub
+1

B ‚Äî Generate PQC keypair & certificate (conceptual)
Because PQC support depends on your OpenSSL + OQS provider installation, exact commands vary. The flow is:

Install liboqs + OQS provider for OpenSSL (follow repo tutorial). 
GitHub

Generate a hybrid key or separate classical + PQ keys (examples vary by provider). Conceptually:

Generate classical key: openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:3072 -out rsa.key

Generate PQ key (name and flags depend on OQS provider): something like openssl genpkey -provider oqsprovider -algorithm kyber768 -out pq_kem.key (real command varies; check OQS/OpenSSL docs). 
developer.ibm.com
+1

Create CSR(s) and have your CA sign them. You may either:

Put the PQ public key in a certificate extension, or

Create hybrid certificates from libraries that support hybrid keys (some experimental tooling does this).

Bundle as PKCS#12 for browser installation:

openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.crt -name "MyClient" -out client.p12

Important: exact OpenSSL commands for PQC keys depend on the provider build ‚Äî use the Open Quantum Safe / IBM tutorials for exact syntax. 
developer.ibm.com
+1

C ‚Äî Server TLS configuration to use hybrid KEMs
Configure your TLS server (nginx/apache/custom) to use OpenSSL 3.x + OQS provider and enable hybrid KEMs (e.g., X25519Kyber768) in TLS 1.3 cipher configuration. Test with osloq/oqs TLS examples. There are tutorials for prototyping hybrid TLS. 
Open Quantum Safe
+1

D ‚Äî Importing the client cert into browsers (multi-device)
Convert certificate + private key to .p12 (PKCS#12) and distribute to devices. Import methods:

Windows/Chrome: Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Manage certificates ‚Üí Import. 
GlobalSign Support

macOS/Safari: Use Keychain Access ‚Üí File ‚Üí Import Items. 
docs.digicert.com

Firefox: has its own certificate store (Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí View Certificates ‚Üí Import).

For automation on many devices, use MDM (mobile device management) tools to push the PKCS#12 and install into the OS cert store.

4) Concrete implementation patterns (practical options)
Option A ‚Äî Hybrid TLS with X.509 client certificates (recommended)
Create classical client certs (RSA/ECDSA) signed by your CA.

Configure server TLS to support hybrid KEMs (X25519+Kyber) via OpenSSL+OQS provider.

Browser imports .p12. When client authenticates, the TLS session uses the negotiated hybrid KEM for confidentiality; client cert is used for client auth. This is the least invasive and works with existing browser client cert UX. 
IETF
+1

Option B ‚Äî WebAuthn / Passkeys using PQC (best UX long-term)
Build or adopt an authenticator (or patched browser) that supports Dilithium for signatures and Kyber for KEMs. Experimental projects and prototypes exist; adoption will grow. Good if you can control authenticators or embed a custom extension. 
GitHub
+1

Option C ‚Äî Application-level PQC with WASM (fast prototyping)
Use a WASM build of liboqs in the browser to do PQC KEM and signatures inside JS. Do a handshake at application level (e.g., exchange public keys via your TLS channel) and then encrypt messages with the shared symmetric key. This avoids relying on full browser PQC support but forces you to handle key lifecycle. 
Open Quantum Safe

5) Compatibility & UX considerations
Browser support is evolving. Chrome/Edge/Firefox are experimenting with hybrid PQC cipher suites; always test the exact browser versions you target. 
thesslstore.com
+1

Certificate size: some PQC signatures/keys are larger than classical ones ‚Äî be mindful of cookie/header sizes and certificate transfer sizes.

Privileged operations: handling private keys in a browser or device means you must protect the .p12 with passwords and, on OSes that support it, store keys in secure keystores (TPM, Secure Enclave, Windows Certificate Store).

Revocation & rotation: PQC algorithms and parameter choices may evolve ‚Äî build crypto-agility so you can rotate algorithms and update certs without rewriting the whole system. 
TechRadar

6) Security precautions
Never distribute private keys unencrypted. Always protect PKCS#12 with a strong password and deliver via secure channels or MDM.

Backup private keys securely (offline HSM or secure backup) and plan key rotation.

Audit and test with interop testbeds (Open Quantum Safe has TLS examples) and fuzz/pen-test your implementation.

8) Example next steps I can do for you right now
Pick any of these and I‚Äôll produce it immediately (copyable):

A step-by-step script to build OpenSSL+OQS on Linux and generate a Kyber/Dilithium keypair + CSR (I‚Äôll include exact commands tailored to Ubuntu vs. CentOS). (I already have the resources ‚Äî tell me which OS.)

A sample server TLS config (nginx or OpenSSL s_server) that enables hybrid cipher suites and requires client certificate authentication.

A PowerShell / Bash snippet to convert .crt+.key to .p12 and instructions to import into Chrome/Firefox on Windows/macOS.

A prototype JS + WASM example that uses liboqs WASM to do a Kyber KEM and exchange a symmetric key application-level (proof of concept).

(If you want one of the above, say which OS & target browsers and I will produce the files/commands right away.)

If you want an immediate concrete artifact, tell me which one of the ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù above you want first (script, server config, import snippet, or WASM POC) and which OS/browsers you‚Äôre targeting ‚Äî I‚Äôll generate the full script/config that you can run/copy.

You said:
Yes give me the Linux script
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚úÖ
Let‚Äôs make a Linux bash script that sets up OpenSSL with Post-Quantum (OQS) provider, generates both RSA and Kyber keys, and builds a hybrid-ready certificate you can later export to browsers.

‚öôÔ∏è What this script will do
Install dependencies (build tools, OpenSSL 3.x, Git, etc.)

Clone and build OpenQuantumSafe (liboqs) and OpenSSL-OQS provider

Generate:

RSA key + self-signed cert

Kyber key + self-signed cert

Combine both into a .p12 file (importable in browsers)

üß© Next Steps
You can now:

Import either .p12 into Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

Use OpenSSL‚Äôs s_server and s_client with -provider oqsprovider to test encrypted communication using Kyber KEM.

Optionally, configure nginx or apache to use your PQC certs with the OQS-enabled OpenSSL.

Would you like me to extend this with a test server/client script next (so you can actually open an encrypted PQC session between two machines)?

You said:
when i run the script the bash crashes
ChatGPT said:
Got it üëç Let‚Äôs fix that properly ‚Äî
if the bash crashed, it usually means one of the build commands failed silently or the OpenSSL/OQS part wasn‚Äôt compatible with your current Linux environment.

Let‚Äôs troubleshoot and then I‚Äôll give you a more stable version of the script that you can safely re-run.

‚ö†Ô∏è Step 1: Tell me your system
Please confirm:

Your Linux distro and version (cat /etc/os-release | grep PRETTY_NAME)

The error line before it crashed (e.g., ‚ÄúCMake Error‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚Äúopenssl: command not found‚Äù)

Do you already have OpenSSL 3 installed? (openssl version)

That helps me tailor the script to your exact setup (Ubuntu 22, Kali, Debian, etc.).

üß© Step 2: Why it crashes (common causes)
Cause	Fix
üß± Missing build tools	install cmake, ninja, perl, pkg-config
üî¢ Using old OpenSSL 1.x system version	needs OpenSSL 3.x
üîí sudo ninja install tries to overwrite system libs	we‚Äôll install locally instead
üíæ Memory / swap too low	compile uses ~2‚Äì3 GB RAM ‚Äî ensure enough space
üì¶ liboqs or oqs-provider branch mismatch	use a tested release tag
‚úÖ Step 3: Use this stable fixed script
This version builds without touching system OpenSSL, in your user folder (~/oqs-local).

Ah ‚Äî perfect catch üîç
That dquote> prompt means your bash is still waiting for a closing quote ("), so the script didn‚Äôt finish properly.
It happens when a line was copied with mismatched or smart quotes.

üß© Here‚Äôs how to fix it
You probably copied these lines with smart quotes (‚Äú ‚Äù) or a missing closing quote.

Let‚Äôs fix it manually:

Press Ctrl + C to cancel the current command (exit the dquote> prompt).
‚Üí You should see your normal terminal prompt again (like $ or user@machine:~$).

Open the script in a text editor:

nano safe_pqc_build.sh
Go to the section near the end and make sure it looks exactly like this (pay attention to the quotes):

"$INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl" pkcs12 -export -inkey kyber.key -in kyber.crt -name "Kyber Device" \
  -out kyber_device.p12 -passout pass:1234

echo "‚úÖ Done!"

Save and exit Nano:

Press Ctrl + O, then Enter to save

Press Ctrl + X to exit

Then rerun:

chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh
./safe_pqc_build.sh
‚úÖ Explanation:
dquote> means "double quote still open".
Bash is waiting for you to close a string like "Hello.
You can always abort with Ctrl + C when you see it.

Would you like me to give you a clean copy-paste safe version (no emojis, no Unicode, no smart quotes) that you can paste directly into the terminal without this issue?

Absolutely üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a fully clean, copy-safe version of the script (no emojis, no smart quotes, and safe for direct terminal paste).

This script builds liboqs and the OpenSSL OQS provider locally (so it won‚Äôt break your system OpenSSL), and then generates a Kyber post-quantum certificate that you can import into your browser.

Run:

chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh
./safe_pqc_build.sh
When it finishes, you‚Äôll find your certificate here:

~/pqc_build/certs/kyber_device.p12
(Password is 1234.)

Would you like me to include RSA + Kyber (hybrid) generation next (so each device can choose between classical and post-quantum encryption when communicating)?

i want to add rsa option too the user should be able to use either rsa encryption or pqc

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs modify your Bash script so it supports both RSA and PQC (Kyber).
When you run it, it‚Äôll ask you to choose between "pqc" or "rsa", and then build and generate the corresponding certificate.

üß† Explanation
When you run:

./build_cert.sh
You‚Äôll see:

Choose certificate type:
1) PQC (Kyber)
2) RSA (2048-bit)
Enter choice [1 or 2]:
If you select 1, it builds liboqs + oqs-provider and makes a Kyber PQC certificate.

If you select 2, it makes a standard RSA certificate using your system OpenSSL.

Both generate a .p12 file that you can import into browsers or use for testing TLS.

Would you like me to make it detect automatically if liboqs is already installed and skip rebuilding it next time (to save time)?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî your script is fine ‚úÖ ‚Äî the problem here isn‚Äôt your Bash script at all.
It‚Äôs Kali‚Äôs package repository that‚Äôs broken or outdated.

üß© The error in plain English
Missing key 827C8569F2518CC677FECA1AED65462EC8D5E4C5
404 Not Found for librhash1 and libssl-dev
That means:

Your APT repository mirror is outdated or temporarily broken.

Some packages (like libssl-dev) have newer versions that your mirror doesn‚Äôt have yet.

The GPG signing key for kali-rolling also needs refreshing.

üõ†Ô∏è Fix steps (copy & paste each one)
1Ô∏è‚É£ Refresh the repository keys
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 827C8569F2518CC677FECA1AED65462EC8D5E4C5
If that fails, use this alternate command:

sudo wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
2Ô∏è‚É£ Fix your /etc/apt/sources.list
Open it:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Make sure it looks like this (only these lines):

deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
üí° Remove or comment (#) any other mirror lines (like ftp.acc.umu.se).

Save with:

Ctrl+O ‚Üí Enter ‚Üí Ctrl+X

3Ô∏è‚É£ Update and fix missing packages
sudo apt update --fix-missing
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -f
Then re-run:

./safe_pqc_build.sh
‚úÖ Optional check
If you want to verify that the issue is gone, run:

sudo apt policy libssl-dev
You should see something like:

libssl-dev:
  Installed: (none)
  Candidate: 3.5.1-1
  Version table:
     3.5.1-1 500
        500 http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling/main amd64 Packages
Would you like me to make a ‚Äúsafe pre-check‚Äù block inside your script ‚Äî so it auto-fixes the Kali repo and keys before running the main build process (so you don‚Äôt need to do this again)?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî that confirms your issue: you‚Äôre still using the Swedish mirror (ftp.acc.umu.se), which is outdated and missing the latest packages (like libssl-dev).

Let‚Äôs fix it properly üëá

üß© Step-by-Step Fix for Kali Mirror Problem
1Ô∏è‚É£ Edit your repository list
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Delete everything inside it and replace it with only this line:

deb http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Then save and exit:

Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the correct Kali signing key
sudo wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -
You should see:

OK
3Ô∏è‚É£ Update and repair packages
sudo apt update --fix-missing
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -f
4Ô∏è‚É£ Check again
sudo apt policy libssl-dev
Now you should see:

500 http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling/main amd64 Packages
(not the ftp.acc.umu.se one anymore).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Rerun your build
./safe_pqc_build.sh
Once that works, I can modify your build script to auto-detect and fix the repository before it starts compiling ‚Äî so next time you won‚Äôt need to touch /etc/apt/sources.list manually.

Would you like me to add that ‚Äúauto-repair‚Äù block at the start of the script?

You said:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(root„âøosboxes)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ# sudo wget -q -O - https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo apt-key add -

sudo: apt-key: command not found
ChatGPT said:
‚úÖ Perfect catch ‚Äî Kali Linux (and other Debian-based distros) have deprecated apt-key for security reasons.
We‚Äôll just use the new trusted method instead.

üß© Use the new, correct method
Run these commands exactly:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc
Then make sure your /etc/apt/sources.list file looks like this:

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Save and close it:

Ctrl + O ‚Üí Enter ‚Üí Ctrl + X

üß± Then update and fix everything
sudo apt update --fix-missing
sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -f
Now test again:

sudo apt policy libssl-dev
You should see:

500 http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling/main amd64 Packages
Then rerun:

./safe_pqc_build.sh
If you‚Äôd like, I can modify your build script to automatically verify and fix this key/repo issue at the start (so it will never break again).
Would you like me to add that section to the top of your script?

ChatGPT said:
That‚Äôs totally fine ‚Äî you‚Äôre almost there.
The error simply means the new GPG key isn‚Äôt registered properly yet, so apt still can‚Äôt verify the Kali repo.

Let‚Äôs fix it the 2025-correct way (works on all current Kali versions).

‚úÖ 1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove any old keys
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/kali* /etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg
‚úÖ 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download and install the new official keyring package
This is the proper secure method (Kali maintainers recommend it):

sudo apt install -y curl gnupg
curl -fsSL https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
That command:

Downloads the official archive-key.asc.

Converts it to the correct .gpg format.

Installs it in /etc/apt/keyrings/.

‚úÖ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Fix /etc/apt/sources.list
Run:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Make sure it contains exactly this line:

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main non-free non-free-firmware contrib
Save (Ctrl+O ‚Üí Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).

‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Now update again
sudo apt update --allow-unauthenticated --fix-missing
After this one finishes cleanly, do:

sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -f
‚úÖ 5Ô∏è‚É£ Verify that it worked
sudo apt policy libssl-dev
You should now see:

500 http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling/main amd64 Packages
and no GPG or missing-key errors.

Once it‚Äôs clean, rerun your script:

./safe_pqc_build.sh
Would you like me to give you an automatic ‚Äúrepo fixer‚Äù snippet that you can paste at the top of any script to make it handle this automatically next time?

ChatGPT said:
Perfect üëç your /etc/apt/sources.list file looks correct ‚Äî that‚Äôs the right official Kali repository.

Now the only issue left is that your system is missing the GPG key (827C8569F2518CC677FECA1AED65462EC8D5E4C5), which verifies Kali package signatures.
Let‚Äôs fix that cleanly (the old apt-key command is deprecated).

üß© Step-by-Step Fix
Run these commands exactly:

# 1. Create the keyrings directory (if it doesn't exist)
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings

# 2. Download the new Kali archive key and save it properly
curl -fsSL https://archive.kali.org/archive-key.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg

# 3. Update your sources.list entry to use the keyring
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Now replace your line with this (copy exactly):

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] http://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X).

‚úÖ Final Step
Now update again:

sudo apt update
You should no longer see:

‚ÄúMissing key ‚Ä¶ which is needed to verify signature‚Äù

Instead, it should say something like:

‚ÄúReading package lists‚Ä¶ Done‚Äù

If you‚Äôd like, I can also give you a single Linux script that does all these steps automatically (creating keyring, downloading key, fixing repo, and updating).
Would you like that?

Perfect üëè Now that your repositories are fixed, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôll do next ‚Äî step by step ‚Äî to get your browser-compatible hybrid RSA + post-quantum certificate working.

üß© STEP 1 ‚Äî Install dependencies
Run these commands to install OpenSSL and basic build tools:

sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev openssl curl
üß© STEP 2 ‚Äî Create directories for building
mkdir -p ~/hybrid_cert/{build,certs}
cd ~/hybrid_cert/build
üß© STEP 3 ‚Äî Generate RSA certificate
openssl genrsa -out rsa.key 2048
openssl req -x509 -new -key rsa.key -days 365 -subj "/CN=Hybrid-RSA" -out rsa.crt
üß© STEP 4 ‚Äî Generate Post-Quantum (Kyber) certificate
We‚Äôll use Open Quantum Safe (OQS) OpenSSL fork for this.
Here‚Äôs a script to automate download, compile, and PQC cert generation üëá

Save this as generate_hybrid_cert.sh:

#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Setup
WORK_DIR=~/hybrid_cert
BUILD_DIR=$WORK_DIR/build
CERT_DIR=$WORK_DIR/certs
INSTALL_DIR=$BUILD_DIR/oqs-openssl
mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR $CERT_DIR

echo "üì¶ Installing dependencies..."
sudo apt install -y git cmake ninja-build

cd $BUILD_DIR
echo "‚¨áÔ∏è Cloning OQS-OpenSSL..."
git clone --branch OQS-OpenSSL_1_1_1-stable https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssl.git oqs-openssl
git clone https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git

cd liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$INSTALL_DIR ..
ninja && ninja install

cd ../..
cd oqs-openssl
./Configure no-shared --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR linux-x86_64 -lm
make -j$(nproc)
make install_sw

echo "üîê Generating Kyber (post-quantum) certificate..."
$INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl req -x509 -new -newkey kyber512 -keyout $CERT_DIR/kyber.key -out $CERT_DIR/kyber.crt -nodes -days 365 -subj "/CN=Hybrid-PQC"

echo "üíæ Creating PKCS12 bundle for browser import..."
$INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey $CERT_DIR/kyber.key -in $CERT_DIR/kyber.crt -name "Kyber Device" -out $CERT_DIR/kyber_device.p12 -passout pass:1234

echo "‚úÖ Done!"
echo "Certificates stored in: $CERT_DIR"
Then make it executable and run it:

chmod +x generate_hybrid_cert.sh
./generate_hybrid_cert.sh
üß© STEP 5 ‚Äî Install certificates in browsers
After it finishes:

Go to your browser settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí Import

Import both:

rsa.crt

kyber_device.p12 (password: 1234)

Now every machine with these installed can:

Use RSA encryption or

Use post-quantum (Kyber) encryption for secure communication.

Would you like me to modify this script so that it automatically installs both certs (RSA + PQC) into Firefox or Chrome after generation?

‚úÖ Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre almost done!
The error you‚Äôre seeing is simply because one of Kali‚Äôs mirrors (mirror1.sox.rs) is down or unreachable.
This is common and easy to fix. Let‚Äôs repair it so libssl-dev finishes installing correctly.

üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Clean and refresh mirrors
Run this first to clean failed downloads and refresh:

sudo apt clean
sudo apt update --fix-missing
üß© Step 2 ‚Äî Force reinstallation from working mirrors
Now re-run your install command, but force it to skip the broken mirror:

sudo apt install -y --fix-missing libssl-dev openssl curl
If it still tries the same broken mirror, you can change to a reliable one manually:

üß© Step 3 ‚Äî Switch to a faster official mirror
Edit your sources list:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Replace everything inside with this official mirror (fast and stable):

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
Save and exit (Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X), then run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev openssl curl
Once it completes successfully, you‚Äôll be fully ready to run the RSA + PQC hybrid certificate builder script we prepared earlier.

Would you like me to make a final unified version of that script that lets the user choose between:

RSA only

PQC only

Hybrid (RSA + PQC)

Perfect ‚Äî this means everything installed successfully except for one package (libssl-dev) because the mirror1.sox.rs server is dead.
We‚Äôll just force Kali to use a good mirror (and skip the broken one) ‚Äî it‚Äôs a 30-second fix üëá

üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Change to a reliable mirror
Run:

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
Replace everything in that file with exactly this:

deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kali-archive-keyring.gpg] http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
Save and exit:
Ctrl + O ‚Üí Enter ‚Üí Ctrl + X

üß© Step 2 ‚Äî Clean and refresh apt cache
sudo apt clean
sudo apt update
You should now see:

Get:1 http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/kali.org/kali kali-rolling InRelease [34.0 kB]
Fetched ...
All packages are up to date.
üß© Step 3 ‚Äî Finally install the missing package
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
‚úÖ Once that succeeds, your OpenSSL environment will be fully ready.
Then we can move on to the hybrid RSA + PQC certificate builder script, which lets you choose encryption mode interactively.

Would you like me to now generate that interactive script (menu-based: RSA / PQC / Hybrid)?

Now that your OpenSSL and dependencies are ready, here‚Äôs the final interactive Linux script that lets you choose between:

üîê RSA encryption

üîê Post-Quantum (Kyber) encryption

‚ö° Hybrid (RSA + PQC)

Each option generates a proper certificate you can import into your browser and use for secure communication between devices.

how to select all then replace??
ChatGPT said:
In GNU nano, here‚Äôs how to select all and replace the whole script easily üëá

üß≠ Option 1: Clear the whole file and paste new script
This is the easiest and safest method.

Open the file in nano

nano safe_pqc_build.sh
Press Ctrl + A then Ctrl + K repeatedly ‚Äî this cuts all lines (empties the file).
(You can also just hold Ctrl + K until the file is empty.)

Paste the new full script you want (right-click or Ctrl + Shift + V).

Press Ctrl + O ‚Üí Enter to save.

Press Ctrl + X to exit.

üß≠ Option 2: Replace text automatically
If you just want to replace certain text or keywords:

In nano, press Ctrl + \ (that‚Äôs the ‚Äúsearch and replace‚Äù shortcut).

Type what you want to find ‚Üí press Enter.

Type the replacement ‚Üí press Enter.

When asked, press A to replace all occurrences.

üß≠ Option 3: If you want to fully overwrite from terminal
If you already have the full new script (e.g., copied from me), you can replace the file in one go:

cat > safe_pqc_build.sh
Then paste the script, and press Ctrl + D to save and exit.

Would you like me to show you the correct final complete script so you can paste it in cleanly?

üíæ Step 3: Save and exit
When done pasting:

Press Ctrl + O ‚Üí Enter (to save).

Press Ctrl + X (to exit nano).

üß© Step 4: Make it executable
Back in your terminal, run:

chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh

./safe_pqc_build.sh: line 25: cd: /root/pqc_build: No such file or directory
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs actually an easy fix! üí™
The script is trying to go to the directory:

/root/pqc_build
but it doesn‚Äôt exist yet.

Let‚Äôs fix that in two possible ways üëá

‚úÖ Option 1: (Recommended) Create the missing folder
Just run this command before rerunning the script:

mkdir -p /root/pqc_build
Then run:

./safe_pqc_build.sh
This will let the script continue normally ‚Äî it‚Äôll use /root/pqc_build as the working directory to generate the certificates.

üß† Option 2: (If you want to use another folder)
If you prefer to keep the build files somewhere else (like your current folder), open the script:

nano safe_pqc_build.sh
Then find this line (around the top):

BUILD_DIR="/root/pqc_build"
Change it to:

BUILD_DIR="$PWD/pqc_build"
Save (Ctrl+O, Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).
This will make the build directory automatically inside your current folder instead.

Would you like me to show you where the generated PQC certificates will appear after you fix it?

You said:
shouldn't this happen automatically wihtin the script ?? as i want to have it as a certificate that i can intall inside any browsers and having them talking toghether
ChatGPT said:
Exactly ‚Äî ideally, the script should create all necessary directories automatically so you don‚Äôt have to manually create them. Right now, your script expects $BUILD_DIR (/root/pqc_build) to already exist, which is why you got that error.

We can fix your script so it always creates the folder before using it, which makes it fully self-contained. Here‚Äôs what you need to do:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure $BUILD_DIR exists
Near the top of your script, after setting BUILD_DIR, add:

# Create build directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR"
For example:

INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/oqs-local"
BUILD_DIR="$HOME/pqc_build"
THREADS=$(nproc)

# Make sure build directory exists
mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR"
This way, the directory is automatically created regardless of whether it exists or not.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure certs folder exists before generating keys
Inside the script where you generate the certificates:

mkdir -p "$BUILD_DIR/certs"
cd "$BUILD_DIR/certs"
You already have this, so this part is fine.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Make it fully portable
The $INSTALL_DIR and $BUILD_DIR should be inside the user‚Äôs home directory ($HOME) rather than /root. This allows any user to run the script and install the certificate in their own browser.

Example:

INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/oqs-local"
BUILD_DIR="$HOME/pqc_build"
This ensures you can install the certificate on any device, in any browser, without touching /root.

üí° Tip: After this change, the script will automatically:

Create the build folder.

Generate PQC (Kyber) and RSA certificates.

Export them as .p12 files ready to import into browsers.

If you want, I can send you a fully updated script that includes:

Automatic folder creation

Choice between PQC, RSA, and hybrid

Everything ready to install in multiple browsers

Do you want me to do that?

You said:

‚úÖ Features of this script:
Fully portable ‚Äî everything under $HOME, no /root dependencies.

Automatically creates $BUILD_DIR and certs/ folders.

Supports PQC (Kyber768), RSA (2048-bit), or Hybrid.

Exports .p12 certificate ready for browser installation.

Environment variables set so OpenSSL can find OQS provider.

You can now:

chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh
./safe_pqc_build.sh
Then choose your encryption type and get a .p12 certificate.

If you want, I can also add a fully automated ‚Äúinstall in browser‚Äù prompt that directly opens Firefox or Chrome and imports the .p12 certificate.

Do you want me to do that next?

Ah! That error happens because the git clone of liboqs failed due to a network issue or HTTP/2 transfer interruption. The download got cut off, leaving an incomplete repository.

Here‚Äôs how to fix it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Remove the incomplete clone
rm -rf /root/pqc_build/liboqs
2Ô∏è‚É£ Use a more reliable git clone method
Sometimes HTTP/2 fails; switching to HTTP/1.1 or increasing buffer size helps.

# Increase Git buffer size
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000  # 500 MB
git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1

# Clone liboqs again
git clone --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git /root/pqc_build/liboqs
3Ô∏è‚É£ Alternative: Use --depth 1 to make it smaller
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git /root/pqc_build/liboqs
This clones only the latest commit and reduces chances of network issues.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Retry build
Once cloned successfully, continue with:

cd /root/pqc_build/liboqs
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$INSTALL_DIR" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DOQS_BUILD_ONLY_LIB=ON ..
ninja -j$(nproc)
ninja install
üí° Tip: Your internet connection may be unstable, or the default Git HTTP/2 support on Kali sometimes causes curl 92. Using HTTP/1.1 and smaller clones fixes it most of the time.

I can also rewrite your script to automatically retry the clone if it fails, so you don‚Äôt have to do this manually every time.

Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:
Ah! That error is because your script is trying to run OpenSSL from the local OQS installation:

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl
‚Ä¶but that file doesn‚Äôt exist yet. This usually happens because liboqs and oqs-provider didn‚Äôt build/install successfully, or the paths in your script are set to /root/oqs-local but the install didn‚Äôt create it there.

Steps to fix
1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify your installation directory
Check if openssl exists:

ls -l /root/oqs-local/bin/openssl
If you see No such file or directory, the build/install didn‚Äôt complete.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Rebuild liboqs and oqs-provider
# Go to your build directory
cd /root/pqc_build

# Remove incomplete builds if any
rm -rf liboqs oqs-provider

# Clone liboqs (with depth 1 to avoid network issues)
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git
cd liboqs
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/root/oqs-local -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DOQS_BUILD_ONLY_LIB=ON ..
ninja -j$(nproc)
ninja install

# Now oqs-provider
cd /root/pqc_build
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider.git
cd oqs-provider
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/root/oqs-local -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr -DOQS_PROVIDER_BUILD_STATIC=OFF ..
ninja -j$(nproc)
ninja install
3Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm the OpenSSL binary
/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl version
You should see something like:

OpenSSL 3.5.3 OQS-provider
4Ô∏è‚É£ Adjust your script
Make sure your script exports the correct path:

export INSTALL_DIR=/root/oqs-local
export OPENSSL_MODULES="$INSTALL_DIR/lib/ossl-modules"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$INSTALL_DIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
Then the PQC commands will work.

üí° Optional: If you want this to work on any device, you can:

Change INSTALL_DIR to a relative path (e.g., $HOME/oqs-local)

Package $INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl and $INSTALL_DIR/lib/ossl-modules together with your script.

I can rewrite your full portable script so it:

Installs OQS/OpenSSL if missing

Offers RSA, PQC, or hybrid options

Creates the .p12 certificates

Works on any Linux machine without manually building every time

Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:
Ah, now it‚Äôs clear why your script still fails: you only built liboqs and oqs-provider, but you did not build a full OpenSSL binary that includes the OQS provider.

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl doesn‚Äôt exist because the OQS provider installs its module (oqsprovider.so), but the OpenSSL binary itself must be compiled separately with OQS support.

Steps to fix
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone OpenSSL 3.x (you need a version compatible with OQS provider)
cd /root/pqc_build
git clone --depth 1 --branch OpenSSL_3_5_3 https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
cd openssl
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure OpenSSL with OQS provider
./Configure --prefix=/root/oqs-local --openssldir=/root/oqs-local \
    enable-ossl-shared
make -j$(nproc)
make install
‚ö†Ô∏è This will create /root/oqs-local/bin/openssl.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify OpenSSL
/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl version
You should see something like:

OpenSSL 3.5.3-dev
4Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm OQS provider is loadable
/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
It should show kyber768 and other post-quantum algorithms.

Once this is done, your safe_pqc_build.sh script will work as intended because /root/oqs-local/bin/openssl exists.

If you want, I can write a fully updated portable script that:

Checks if OpenSSL + OQS provider exists

Builds them if missing

Generates PQC, RSA, or hybrid .p12 certificates

‚Ä¶and works on any Linux machine without manually building every time.

Do you want me to do that?

Apologies for the confusion earlier. The correct branch name for OpenSSL 3.5.3 is openssl-3.5.3, not OpenSSL_3_5_3. Let's proceed with the correct steps to build OpenSSL 3.5.3 with the OQS provider.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Guide to Build OpenSSL 3.5.3 with OQS Provider
1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the OpenSSL 3.5.3 Repository
cd /root/pqc_build
git clone --depth 1 --branch openssl-3.5.3 https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
cd openssl
2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure OpenSSL with OQS Provider
./Configure --prefix=/root/oqs-local --openssldir=/root/oqs-local enable-ossl-shared
make -j$(nproc)
make install
This will install OpenSSL to /root/oqs-local, including the OQS provider.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the Installation
/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl version
You should see output similar to:

OpenSSL 3.5.3 16 Sep 2025
4Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm the OQS Provider is Loaded
/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
This should display a list of supported algorithms, including PQC options like kyber768.

üîÑ Alternative: Build OpenSSL 3.5.3 from Source
If you prefer to download and build OpenSSL 3.5.3 from source:

Download the Source Code:

cd /root/pqc_build
wget https://github.com/openssl/openssl/archive/refs/tags/openssl-3.5.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf openssl-3.5.3.tar.gz
cd openssl-openssl-3.5.3
Configure and Build:

./config --prefix=/root/oqs-local --openssldir=/root/oqs-local enable-ossl-shared
make -j$(nproc)
make install
Verify the Installation:

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl version
You should see:

OpenSSL 3.5.3 16 Sep 2025
Confirm the OQS Provider is Loaded:

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
This should display the supported PQC algorithms.

üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps
Once OpenSSL 3.5.3 with the OQS provider is installed, your script should function as intended. If you encounter any further issues or need assistance with the script, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT said:
Ah! That error happens because in OpenSSL 3.5.x the enable-ossl-shared option does not exist. Instead, shared libraries are enabled using shared. Let‚Äôs fix this.

Correct Build Steps for OpenSSL 3.5.3
Navigate to the source folder (you‚Äôre already there):

cd /root/pqc_build/openssl
Configure OpenSSL with shared libraries:

./Configure --prefix=/root/oqs-local --openssldir=/root/oqs-local shared
‚úÖ Notes:

shared enables .so libraries.

--prefix sets the installation folder.

--openssldir sets the OpenSSL config folder.

Build and install:

make -j$(nproc)
make install
Verify the installation:

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl version
You should see:

OpenSSL 3.5.3 16 Sep 2025
Check the OQS provider (after building the OQS provider module):

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
If you want, I can write a full ready-to-run script that:

Builds liboqs

Builds the OQS OpenSSL provider

Builds OpenSSL 3.5.3 correctly

Generates fully portable certificates (Kyber/RSA)

This way you won‚Äôt have to manually run each step again.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
make -j$(nproc)
this command has benn running for 10 min is this normal?
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî for OpenSSL 3.5.3, compiling can take several minutes depending on your system. Using -j$(nproc) tells make to use all CPU cores, which speeds up compilation but still might take 5‚Äì15 minutes on typical VMs or laptops.

Some points to consider:

CPU speed & cores: On slower CPUs or 1‚Äì2 core VMs, it‚Äôs normal to take longer.

RAM: Make needs some memory for compiling; if your system is low on RAM, it may slow down.

Check progress: You can open a second terminal and run:

htop
to see if make is actively using CPU. If yes ‚Üí it‚Äôs still working.

Interrupting: Don‚Äôt stop it unless it‚Äôs stuck for hours with no CPU activity.

üí° Tip: For debugging, you can compile without -j$(nproc) (make) to see output line by line, but it will be slower.

If you want, I can give you a step-by-step ‚Äúfastest build method‚Äù for OpenSSL + OQS + Kyber certificates that minimizes waiting and errors. Do you want me to do that?

ChatGPT said:
Ah! This error explains why your PQC (Kyber) commands fail ‚Äî OpenSSL can‚Äôt find the OQS provider shared library or its dependencies. Specifically:

liboqs.so.9: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
This happens because the dynamic linker doesn‚Äôt know where liboqs.so is installed. You installed it in /root/oqs-local/lib. There are two ways to fix this:

Option 1: Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH temporarily
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/root/oqs-local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -provider-path /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ossl-modules -public-key-algorithms
Explanation:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH tells Linux where to find shared libraries (liboqs.so in this case).

-provider-path tells OpenSSL where the provider .so file is (oqsprovider.so).

Option 2: Make it permanent
Add this line to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oqs.conf:

/root/oqs-local/lib
Then run:

sudo ldconfig
This registers liboqs.so system-wide.

After this, OpenSSL should find oqsprovider.so automatically.

‚úÖ Once this is done, test again:

/root/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
You should see Kyber and other PQC algorithms listed.

If you want, I can give you a fully corrected script that sets these variables automatically so generating PQC certificates becomes fully portable.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
yes
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! Here's a fully self-contained, portable safe_pqc_build.sh script that:

Automatically sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH for liboqs.

Points OpenSSL to the OQS provider.

Creates a build directory if it doesn‚Äôt exist.

‚úÖ Features
Portable: Uses LD_LIBRARY_PATH and OPENSSL_MODULES to load the OQS provider anywhere.

PKCS#12 Output: *.p12 files can be imported into browsers or devices.

Hybrid Support: Combines RSA + PQC into a single PKCS#12.

Auto Directory Creation: Creates pqc_build and oqs-local automatically.

To run:

chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh
./safe_pqc_build.sh
If you want, I can also provide a version that automatically builds OpenSSL + OQS provider if not found, so you don‚Äôt have to manually compile anything.

Do you want me to do that too?

2.2 How it works
Environment Setup:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH points to the local installation of liboqs so the custom OpenSSL can load it.

OPENSSL_MODULES points to the directory containing the oqsprovider.so shared library.

Custom OpenSSL Invocation:

The script uses the custom OpenSSL binary: $INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl.

This OpenSSL is compiled with OQS provider support to generate PQC keys.

Certificate Generation:

PQC (Kyber768): Uses the OQS provider.

RSA (2048-bit): Uses standard OpenSSL RSA routines.

Hybrid: Combines RSA and PQC certificates into a single PKCS#12 file.

Export to PKCS#12:

PKCS#12 format stores private key + certificate.

Password-protected for secure installation into browsers or devices.

5. How to Use the Tool
5.1 Running the Script
chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh
./safe_pqc_build.sh
5.2 Menu Options
Choose encryption type:
1) PQC (Kyber768)
2) RSA (2048-bit)
3) Hybrid (RSA + PQC)
4) Verify connection between two devices
Option 1: Generates Kyber768 PQC certificate.

Option 2: Generates RSA 2048 certificate.

Option 3: Generates Hybrid certificate combining RSA + PQC.

Option 4: Lists supported PQC algorithms to verify OQS provider is working.

5.3 Output
Certificates and keys are stored in ~/pqc_build/certs.

PKCS#12 files (.p12) are password-protected (1234 by default).

Example files:

kyber_device.p12 ‚Üí PQC

rsa_device.p12 ‚Üí RSA

hybrid_device.p12 ‚Üí Hybrid

6. Using the Certificates in Browsers
6.1 Chrome / Edge
Open chrome://settings/certificates.

Click Import.

Select .p12 file.

Enter password (1234) when prompted.

Complete wizard to import certificate.

6.2 Firefox
Open Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí View Certificates.

Click Import.

Select .p12 file.

Enter password (1234) and confirm.

The certificate is now usable.

Note: Hybrid certificates allow the browser to negotiate either RSA or PQC-based TLS with servers that support it.

7. Verification
To verify that the OQS provider is available:

export OPENSSL_MODULES=~/oqs-local/lib/ossl-modules
~/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
You should see:

Kyber512
Kyber768
Kyber1024
8. Implementation Explanation
8.1 How PQC Works in OpenSSL
Provider Concept: OpenSSL 3.x introduces providers ‚Äî modules that implement algorithms.

OQS Provider: Implements post-quantum algorithms like Kyber, Dilithium.

Integration: Our OpenSSL binary is compiled with the OQS provider. Environment variable OPENSSL_MODULES points OpenSSL to oqsprovider.so.

Certificate Generation: Using genpkey -provider oqsprovider -algorithm kyber768.

8.2 Hybrid Certificates
Hybrid certificates include both:

RSA 2048 keypair

PQC (Kyber768) keypair

This ensures compatibility with both legacy and post-quantum-ready clients.

8.3 PKCS#12
Standard format for storing private key + certificate.

Supported by all major browsers and devices.

Password-protected to secure private keys.

9. Security Considerations
Always keep PKCS#12 password secure.

PQC algorithms provide security against quantum attacks.

Hybrid certificates ensure backward compatibility.

10. Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
cannot load shared library oqsprovider.so	Ensure LD_LIBRARY_PATH and OPENSSL_MODULES are correctly set.
OpenSSL command not found	Verify custom OpenSSL is built and installed to $INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl.
Browser rejects PKCS#12	Ensure correct password (1234 by default) and proper PKCS#12 format.
Git clone fails	Use --depth 1 and check network connectivity.
11. Summary
safe_pqc_build.sh is a fully portable certificate generation tool for PQC, RSA, and Hybrid certificates. It allows testing, deployment, and secure browser/device communication, ensuring future-proof post-quantum readiness.

If you want, I can also create a nice PDF version with diagrams, showing how the PQC + RSA flow works, and a step-by-step visual guide for browser import.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
where is Select .p12 file.
ChatGPT said:
Ah! That step happens inside the browser‚Äôs certificate import dialog. The ‚ÄúSelect .p12 file‚Äù part isn‚Äôt done on the command line‚Äîit‚Äôs a file picker you interact with in the browser. Here's exactly how it looks per browser:

Chrome / Edge
Open: chrome://settings/certificates

Or go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Manage Certificates.

Click Import.

A file dialog opens.

Navigate to your generated certificate folder:

~/pqc_build/certs
Select the .p12 file you want to import (for example: kyber_device.p12).

Enter the password (1234) when prompted.

Complete the wizard ‚Üí the certificate is now installed.

Firefox
Open: Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí View Certificates ‚Üí Your Certificates ‚Üí Import

Navigate to:

~/pqc_build/certs
Select the .p12 file (kyber_device.p12, rsa_device.p12, or hybrid_device.p12).

Enter the password (1234).

Finish the wizard ‚Üí certificate installed.

So ‚ÄúSelect .p12 file‚Äù is literally choosing your generated PKCS#12 file from the certificate folder in the browser‚Äôs import interface.

If you want, I can make a full step-by-step visual guide showing exactly how to do it in both Chrome/Edge and Firefox, with screenshots of the dialogs. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
how to Navigate to your generated certificate folder:
ChatGPT said:
When you see ‚ÄúNavigate to your generated certificate folder,‚Äù it means you need to locate the folder on your system where the script saved the .p12 certificate. Here‚Äôs how to do it step by step:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Default Folder from Your Script
Based on your safe_pqc_build.sh script, certificates are saved here:

/root/pqc_build/certs
And the files will look like:

kyber_device.p12

rsa_device.p12

hybrid_device.p12 (if you generated hybrid)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Finding the Folder in a File Dialog
When importing in a browser:

A file selection window will open.

Use the file browser to go to /root/pqc_build/certs.

If your file browser doesn‚Äôt allow root folders, you may need to copy the .p12 file to your home directory first:

cp /root/pqc_build/certs/kyber_device.p12 ~/Desktop/
Then, in the import dialog, select Desktop and pick kyber_device.p12.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the File Exists
In the terminal, run:

ls -l /root/pqc_build/certs
You should see:

-rw------- 1 root root 12345 Oct 26 15:00 kyber_device.p12
-rw------- 1 root root 12345 Oct 26 15:00 rsa_device.p12
This confirms the file is there and ready for import.

If you want, I can make a full step-by-step guide for installing the .p12 in browsers starting from this folder.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
inside home?
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs usually easier to work with certificates from your home directory because some browsers or GUI file dialogs cannot access /root directly.

Here‚Äôs how you can do it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Copy the .p12 file to your home directory
cp /root/pqc_build/certs/kyber_device.p12 ~/
or to a subfolder:

mkdir -p ~/certs
cp /root/pqc_build/certs/kyber_device.p12 ~/certs/
Now the certificate is in your home folder (~/ or ~/certs) which is accessible to file dialogs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the copy
ls -l ~/certs
You should see:

-rw------- 1 root root 12345 Oct 26 15:00 kyber_device.p12
3Ô∏è‚É£ Use it in the browser
When prompted to ‚ÄúSelect .p12 file‚Äù, navigate to:

/home/<your-username>/certs/kyber_device.p12
Enter the password you set in the script (1234 by default).

If you want, I can give you a complete browser import guide for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge with screenshots (well, instructions) showing exactly where to click.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
can you make a softlink to my home?
ChatGPT said:
Yes! You can create a symbolic link (soft link) from your home directory to the folder where your .p12 certificate is stored. This way, you can access it easily without moving the files.

Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a certs folder in your home (optional)
mkdir -p ~/certs
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create the soft link
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/certs/oqs_certs
Explanation:

ln -s ‚Üí creates a symbolic link

/root/pqc_build/certs ‚Üí the original folder

~/certs/oqs_certs ‚Üí the name of the link in your home directory

Now you have a link:

~/certs/oqs_certs -> /root/pqc_build/certs
3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the link
ls -l ~/certs
Output should show something like:

oqs_certs -> /root/pqc_build/certs
‚úÖ 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access your .p12 file from the browser
When browsing for the certificate, navigate to:

/home/<your-username>/certs/oqs_certs/kyber_device.p12
If you want, I can give you a one-liner command that creates the link and moves any .p12 files automatically into your home for easier access. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
can we cd to desktop first?
ChatGPT said:
Yes! You can definitely create the symbolic link (or copy/move files) to your Desktop instead of your home folder. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to your Desktop
cd ~/Desktop
~ refers to your home directory.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a symbolic link to your certificates folder
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs oqs_certs
Now on your Desktop, you‚Äôll see:

oqs_certs -> /root/pqc_build/certs
3Ô∏è‚É£ Access your .p12 file
You can now go to your Desktop ‚Üí oqs_certs ‚Üí kyber_device.p12 to select it in your browser.

If you want, I can give a shortcut command that automatically places the .p12 file directly on your Desktop for easy browser installation. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(root„âøosboxes)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ# cd ~/Desktop

cd: no such file or directory: /root/Desktop
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(root„âøosboxes)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ# 
ChatGPT said:
Ah! That explains it ‚Äî the Desktop folder doesn‚Äôt exist by default in the root account. You can either create it or put the link somewhere else.

Here‚Äôs how to create it and make the symlink:

mkdir -p ~/Desktop
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/Desktop/oqs_certs
mkdir -p ~/Desktop ‚Üí creates the Desktop folder if it doesn‚Äôt exist.

ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/Desktop/oqs_certs ‚Üí creates a shortcut called oqs_certs on the Desktop pointing to your certificates.

After this, you can access your .p12 files via /root/Desktop/oqs_certs.

Do you want me to also make it accessible from a normal (non-root) user Desktop?

You said:
let's go to home
ChatGPT said:
You‚Äôre already in your home directory (/root).

If you want to see your files or folders in home, just run:

ls -la ~
This will list everything in your home directory, including hidden files.

Do you want to create a folder here for your certificates so it‚Äôs easy to access?

You said:
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/certs/oqs_certs
i think the path on the right is wrong
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî the path on the right side of ln -s should be the link name you want to create, not an existing directory (unless you want it inside an existing folder).

For example, if you want a symlink oqs_certs inside your home directory pointing to /root/pqc_build/certs, you can do:

ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/oqs_certs
This will create:

/root/oqs_certs -> /root/pqc_build/certs
Then you can access your certificates easily via:

cd ~/oqs_certs
ls
Do you want me to explain how to make it inside a specific subfolder like ~/certs/oqs_certs too?

You said:
no i mean the path as i am in /home/certs
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it! If you are currently in /home/certs, and you want to create a symlink there pointing to /root/pqc_build/certs, the command should be:

ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs oqs_certs
This will create:

/home/certs/oqs_certs -> /root/pqc_build/certs
No ~/ is needed here, because ~ expands to /root when you are root, but you‚Äôre already in /home/certs.

After this, you can just do:

cd oqs_certs
ls
to see your certificate files.

Do you want me to also make it accessible from your normal home directory for easier browser import?

You said:

‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(root„âøosboxes)-[/home/osboxes]
‚îî‚îÄ# 
ChatGPT said:
Ah, almost there! The command you ran:

ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs certs/oqs_certs
tries to create a link inside certs/, but if the folder certs/ doesn‚Äôt exist in /home/osboxes, it will fail silently.

Better is to create the symlink directly in your home directory:

ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/oqs_certs
This will give you:

/home/osboxes/oqs_certs -> /root/pqc_build/certs
Then you can just do:

cd ~/oqs_certs
ls
to see your .p12 and other generated certificates.

Do you want me to show how to import that .p12 into a browser next?

You said:

ChatGPT said:
Ah, the errors make sense:

File exists ‚Äî You already have something at that path.

No such file or directory ‚Äî The parent folder (certs1) doesn‚Äôt exist, so ln can‚Äôt create a link inside it.

Here‚Äôs the clean way to do it:

Option 1: Create the link directly in your home
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/oqs_certs
Creates: /home/osboxes/oqs_certs ‚Üí /root/pqc_build/certs

No need for certs or certs1 folders.

Option 2: If you want it inside an existing folder
mkdir -p ~/certs        # make sure parent exists
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/certs/oqs_certs
Now you can access your certs at /home/osboxes/certs/oqs_certs.

After this, you can just:

cd ~/oqs_certs
ls
to see all your .p12 files.

Do you want me to guide you next on importing the .p12 into a browser?

You said:
When I opened the folder on Firefox, it gives me Recent, Home, Desktop, Document, Download, and stuff. How can I access the location of the certificate? Because I want to import it from those.
ChatGPT said:
Ah! Firefox doesn‚Äôt let you browse arbitrary system paths like /root directly. It only shows folders inside your home directory (/home/osboxes) and standard user folders (Desktop, Documents, etc.). That‚Äôs why your /root/pqc_build/certs isn‚Äôt showing.

To make it accessible to Firefox, you need to place or link your certificate somewhere inside your home directory that Firefox can see. Here‚Äôs how:

Option 1: Move the certificates
mkdir -p ~/Certificates
cp /root/pqc_build/certs/*.p12 ~/Certificates/
This copies all .p12 files to /home/osboxes/Certificates.

In Firefox, go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí View Certificates ‚Üí Import, then navigate to Home ‚Üí Certificates.

Option 2: Create a symlink inside your home
mkdir -p ~/Certificates   # ensure parent exists
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs ~/Certificates/oqs_certs
Now Firefox can see it at Home ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí oqs_certs.

After this, when importing in Firefox, select the .p12 file and provide the password (1234 if you used the script defaults).

If you want, I can give you a step-by-step guide for importing into Firefox and Chrome, including trusting it so sites can communicate using it. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
When I run the command and then I open the home, there is no such file with the same. Okay, I want you to ensure that the links that you are giving me and I am putting inside the Command Prompt are the same links that will appear inside Firefox, ensuring that I am in the Command Prompt route and in Firefox I run as a user named os-boxes. Okay, and you should understand that when I am accessing home, it's called slash home slash os-boxes.
ChatGPT said:
Ah! Perfect ‚Äî now I understand exactly. You are running Firefox as the user osboxes, so the home directory that Firefox sees is:

/home/osboxes
Any path outside of /home/osboxes (like /root/pqc_build/certs) will not be visible in Firefox. So we need to make sure the certificate is either copied or linked inside /home/osboxes in a way that Firefox can see.

Here‚Äôs a clean, working method:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Make a folder inside your user home
mkdir -p /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs
This ensures Firefox can see it under Home ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí oqs_certs.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Copy your .p12 certificates there
cp /root/pqc_build/certs/*.p12 /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs/
Now the files are physically inside your home, so Firefox can access them.

3Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) If you really want a symlink instead of copying)
ln -s /root/pqc_build/certs /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs_link
Firefox will see Home ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí oqs_certs_link, but note: if Firefox cannot follow symlinks to /root, it may fail because /root requires root permissions.

‚úÖ Safer method is to copy the files.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Open Firefox and import
Open Firefox as normal user osboxes.

Go to Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí View Certificates ‚Üí Your Certificates ‚Üí Import.

Navigate to Home ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí oqs_certs (or oqs_certs_link if you used the symlink).

Select your .p12 file and enter the password (default from your script: 1234).

üí° Important: Firefox cannot see /root at all because it‚Äôs a separate user (root). You must place the certificates inside /home/osboxes.

If you want, I can give you a ready-to-run command sequence that moves everything automatically from /root/pqc_build/certs to /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs, so it will show perfectly in Firefox.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
When I prison it, it told me that it doesn't have the read permission. What should I do?
ChatGPT said:
Ah! That makes sense ‚Äî the problem is file permissions. Your .p12 files are in /root/pqc_build/certs, which is owned by root. Even if you copy them into /home/osboxes, they might still lack read permission for your user. Firefox runs as osboxes, so it must be able to read the files.

Here‚Äôs how to fix it safely:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Change ownership (recommended)
sudo chown -R osboxes:osboxes /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs
This makes you (osboxes) the owner of the folder and all files inside.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ensure read permissions
chmod -R 600 /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs/*.p12
600 means owner can read/write, others have no access.

Firefox only needs read access, and since you own it now, this is enough.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Verify
ls -l /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs
You should see something like:

-rw------- 1 osboxes osboxes  1024 Oct 26 14:30 kyber_device.p12
-rw------- 1 osboxes osboxes  1024 Oct 26 14:30 rsa_device.p12
Now when you open Firefox and import, it will have access and won‚Äôt complain about permissions.

If you want, I can give a one-liner that copies your .p12 files from root and fixes permissions in one go, ready for Firefox.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
After I selected the certificate, it's not appearing in the Certificate Manager within Firefox. Why is that?
ChatGPT said:
Ah, I see exactly what‚Äôs happening. There are a few common causes why a .p12 certificate doesn‚Äôt show up in Firefox after import, even if you can select it:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Password Issue
.p12 files are password-protected (in your script, it was 1234).

If you enter the wrong password during import, Firefox silently fails to add it.

‚úÖ Fix: Make sure you enter the exact password you set when generating it (1234).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Wrong Certificate Type
Firefox separates Personal certificates, Authorities, and Servers.

Your .p12 files are personal identity certificates.

Make sure you‚Äôre looking under:
Preferences ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí View Certificates ‚Üí Your Certificates

3Ô∏è‚É£ File Permissions / Access
Firefox must be able to read the file.

Even if you copied it to /home/osboxes, the file needs read permission for your user:

chmod 600 /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs/*.p12
The folder itself also needs execute permission for traversal:

chmod 700 /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs
4Ô∏è‚É£ Corrupted or Incomplete .p12
If the .p12 file wasn‚Äôt fully created (e.g., interrupted script), Firefox won‚Äôt import it.

Test the .p12 by listing its contents:

openssl pkcs12 -info -in /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs/kyber_device.p12 -passin pass:1234
You should see the certificate and private key details.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Firefox Profile Issue
If you run Firefox as a different user (like root or with sudo), it won‚Äôt see the certificate in your regular osboxes profile.

Always run Firefox as the user you want to import for (osboxes).

üí° Tip: Start fresh: copy the .p12 files to /home/osboxes/Certificates/oqs_certs, fix permissions, then import from the correct Firefox profile.

If you want, I can give you a step-by-step procedure that guarantees your Kyber and RSA .p12 files appear correctly in Firefox, ready for TLS use. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Okay, now I successfully built it in the browser, but I want you to give me a small document explaining how I can build it inside the browser, because I don't want the same mistake to re-happen again.
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely! Here's a concise document you can save or print to guide you for building and importing your PQC/RSA certificates inside Firefox, ensuring you don‚Äôt repeat the previous mistakes.

Guide: Building and Using PQC/RSA Certificates in Firefox
1. Prerequisites
Make sure the following are installed on your system:

Git

CMake & Ninja

OpenSSL development libraries (libssl-dev)

Build tools: build-essential, pkg-config

Verify with:

git --version
cmake --version
ninja --version
openssl version
2. Setting up the Build Environment
Create a working folder:

mkdir -p ~/pqc_build
cd ~/pqc_build
Clone the required repositories:

# PQC library
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.git

# OQS OpenSSL provider
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-provider.git
Create installation folder:

mkdir -p ~/oqs-local
3. Build liboqs
cd ~/pqc_build/liboqs
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/oqs-local -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DOQS_BUILD_ONLY_LIB=ON ..
ninja -j$(nproc)
ninja install
4. Build OQS OpenSSL Provider
cd ~/pqc_build/oqs-provider
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/oqs-local -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr -DOQS_PROVIDER_BUILD_STATIC=OFF ..
ninja -j$(nproc)
ninja install
5. Build OpenSSL with PQC Support
Clone OpenSSL:

cd ~/pqc_build
git clone --depth 1 --branch openssl-3.5.3 https://github.com/openssl/openssl.git
cd openssl
Configure and build OpenSSL:

./Configure --prefix=~/oqs-local --openssldir=~/oqs-local
make -j$(nproc)
make install
Verify the provider:

~/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
6. Generate Certificates
You can use the script safe_pqc_build.sh:

cd ~/pqc_build
chmod +x safe_pqc_build.sh
./safe_pqc_build.sh
Select option 1: PQC (Kyber)

Select option 2: RSA

Certificates are saved in: ~/pqc_build/certs

.p12 file password: 1234

7. Prepare Certificates for Firefox
Copy certificates to a readable folder in your home:

mkdir -p ~/Certificates/oqs_certs
cp ~/pqc_build/certs/*.p12 ~/Certificates/oqs_certs/
chmod 600 ~/Certificates/oqs_certs/*.p12
chmod 700 ~/Certificates/oqs_certs
Open Firefox as your normal user (osboxes)

Navigate to:
Preferences ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí View Certificates ‚Üí Your Certificates ‚Üí Import

Select your .p12 file and enter the password (1234).

8. Notes & Troubleshooting
Always run Firefox as the same user that owns the .p12 files.

Ensure the .p12 files have read permissions (chmod 600).

If the certificate doesn‚Äôt appear, check that you are importing it under ‚ÄúYour Certificates‚Äù.

Test .p12 integrity with OpenSSL:

openssl pkcs12 -info -in ~/Certificates/oqs_certs/kyber_device.p12 -passin pass:1234
‚úÖ Following these steps ensures that your PQC/RSA certificates are fully portable, browser-ready, and repeatable.

If you want, I can also draw a small diagram showing the flow from ‚ÄúScript ‚Üí .p12 ‚Üí Firefox ‚Üí TLS usage,‚Äù which makes it super easy to follow next time. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
I want to extend this idea so I can use a client and server, and then both will be able to communicate together using the certificate that we just generated. What are the steps that I would need to use, and will they be able to communicate, and how will they communicate in the browser? Will I have to build a web application, or is there a way? I don't really get it.
ChatGPT said:
Perfect question ‚Äî this is exactly the next logical step after building and importing your PQC certificates.
Let‚Äôs break this down clearly and practically.

üß© Goal
You want to:

Use your generated PQC (post-quantum) or hybrid certificate

Set up a server that uses it for TLS

Have a client (like Firefox or another program) connect securely to it using that certificate.

‚öôÔ∏è How it works conceptually
1. The certificate and private key
The .p12 or .crt + .key you generated represent your identity.

The server uses it to prove its identity to the client.

The client (browser or command-line tool) verifies the server‚Äôs certificate using its trusted CA.

If client authentication is enabled (mutual TLS), the client also presents its own certificate.

üåê Option 1: Browser-based HTTPS (Web server + browser)
‚úÖ What you‚Äôll do
You‚Äôll set up a local web server (like Apache, Nginx, or a small OpenSSL demo server) that uses your PQC certificate.

Then, you‚Äôll visit it in Firefox, which will perform the TLS handshake using PQC algorithms (via the OQS provider you built).

üîß Steps
1. Prepare your certificate and key
Make sure you have:

server_cert.pem
server_key.pem
If you only have .p12, extract them:

openssl pkcs12 -in your_cert.p12 -clcerts -nokeys -out server_cert.pem -passin pass:1234
openssl pkcs12 -in your_cert.p12 -nocerts -out server_key.pem -passin pass:1234 -passout pass:1234
openssl rsa -in server_key.pem -out server_key.pem -passin pass:1234
2. Run a simple OpenSSL-based HTTPS server
Use your custom OpenSSL build (with OQS support):

~/oqs-local/bin/openssl s_server -accept 4433 \
  -cert server_cert.pem \
  -key server_key.pem \
  -www \
  -provider oqsprovider \
  -provider default
This starts a TLS server on port 4433.

3. Test connection in browser
Open Firefox and visit:
https://localhost:4433

Firefox should prompt that the certificate isn‚Äôt trusted (because it‚Äôs self-signed).

Click Advanced ‚Üí Accept the risk.

You‚Äôll now connect using PQC-enabled TLS. üéâ

üß† What‚Äôs happening
Firefox initiates a TLS handshake ‚Üí OpenSSL responds ‚Üí the OQS provider handles the PQC part (e.g., Kyber key exchange, Dilithium signature).
The connection is encrypted and authenticated using post-quantum-safe primitives.

‚öôÔ∏è Option 2: Command-line Client + Server (no browser)
If you want both sides to be under your control (no browser):

1. Run server
~/oqs-local/bin/openssl s_server -accept 4433 \
  -cert server_cert.pem -key server_key.pem \
  -provider oqsprovider -provider default
2. Run client
~/oqs-local/bin/openssl s_client -connect localhost:4433 \
  -provider oqsprovider -provider default
You‚Äôll see the TLS handshake output ‚Äî including PQC algorithm names and certificates.

üí° Option 3: Web Application Integration
If your goal is to make a real web app (say, a secure website using PQC), you‚Äôll:

Use Nginx or Apache built against your custom OpenSSL.

Configure them to use your PQC certificates.

Serve your website (HTML/JS app) normally over HTTPS.

Firefox (or Chromium with PQC support) will perform post-quantum TLS automatically.

This is the ‚Äúproduction-style‚Äù version of what the above demo does.

üîÑ Summary: What you can do next
Goal	What to use	Browser involvement
Test PQC TLS handshake	s_server + s_client	‚ùå
See PQC handshake in Firefox	s_server + Firefox	‚úÖ
Run real web app	Nginx/Apache + PQC certs	‚úÖ
Mutual (client + server) auth	Two .p12 certs (one per side)	‚úÖ (import both)
üîê Optional ‚Äì Mutual TLS (client and server certs)
You can generate one cert for the server and one for the client using your script.
Then run:

~/oqs-local/bin/openssl s_server -accept 4433 \
  -cert server_cert.pem -key server_key.pem \
  -CAfile rootCA.pem -verify 1 \
  -provider oqsprovider -provider default
And connect:

~/oqs-local/bin/openssl s_client -connect localhost:4433 \
  -cert client_cert.pem -key client_key.pem \
  -CAfile rootCA.pem \
  -provider oqsprovider -provider default
Now both authenticate each other!

üöÄ Next Level (Optional)
If you want to make it browser-accessible without running OpenSSL directly, we can:

Configure Apache or Nginx with your OQS OpenSSL build.

Host a React or Flask app that uses HTTPS with PQC support.

Would you like me to prepare a ‚ÄúPQC Web Server + Firefox test setup guide‚Äù next ‚Äî showing how to configure Nginx or Apache to serve your PQC certificates for the browser? That‚Äôs the next step to make it fully interactive and web-based.

how can i put this on github
by commands
ChatGPT said:
Perfect üëè‚Äî putting your project (like your safe_pqc_build.sh, the certs/, and maybe a README.md) on GitHub is a great idea for portability and sharing.

Let‚Äôs go step-by-step using terminal commands only üíª

üß† You‚Äôll do this:
Log into GitHub

Create a new empty repository

Push your local files (script, certs, docs, etc.) into it

‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-step Commands
1Ô∏è‚É£ Go to your project directory
cd ~/pqc_build
2Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize a Git repository
git init
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add your files
You can include everything, or just key files:

git add safe_pqc_build.sh
git add certs/
git add README.md
If you want to add everything:

git add .
4Ô∏è‚É£ Commit your work
git commit -m "Initial commit: PQC certificate builder and demo"
5Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new empty repo on GitHub
Go to https://github.com/new

Name it, for example:
pqc-cert-demo

Don‚Äôt add a README, .gitignore, or license yet (you already have local files)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Connect your local repo to GitHub
Replace <YOUR-USERNAME> with your GitHub username:

git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/pqc-cert-demo.git
7Ô∏è‚É£ Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
If prompted for credentials:

Use your GitHub username

For password ‚Üí use a personal access token (PAT)
(you can generate one from [GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)]).

‚úÖ 8Ô∏è‚É£ Verify
Go to your GitHub repo page ‚Äî you should now see:

safe_pqc_build.sh

certs/

README.md

(any other files you added)

üß© Optional cleanup
If you don‚Äôt want to upload your certificates (for security reasons), add a .gitignore file:

echo "certs/" > .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Ignore certificates directory"
git push
üß† Example summary
cd ~/pqc_build
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial PQC build script"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/hana-tamer/pqc-cert-demo.git
git push -u origin main
Would you like me to generate a README.md template for this project (explaining what it does, how to run it, etc.) before you upload it?
That way your GitHub page will look professional and ready to share.

ChatGPT said:
Good catch ‚ö° ‚Äî the error

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/...': Could not resolve host: github.com
means your system can‚Äôt reach GitHub‚Äôs servers (DNS/network issue, not a Git one).

Let‚Äôs fix it üëá

üß© Step 1 ‚Äî Check internet connection
Run:

ping -c 3 github.com
If it says ‚Äúunknown host‚Äù or ‚Äúunreachable‚Äù, your VM (Kali/Server) isn‚Äôt connected to the internet.

If you‚Äôre on VirtualBox:

Go to Settings ‚Üí Network

Set Adapter 1 to NAT

Restart your VM

Then test again:

ping -c 3 github.com
üß© Step 2 ‚Äî Check DNS resolution
If still broken, try editing your DNS:

echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
Then test again:

ping -c 3 github.com
üß© Step 3 ‚Äî Once ping works
Try pushing again:

git push -u origin main
üß© Step 4 (if still fails)
Sometimes SSL verification can fail in older systems ‚Äî you can test connection manually:

curl -v https://github.com
If that fails, your CA certificates might be outdated:

apt update && apt install ca-certificates -y
update-ca-certificates
Then re-run the push.

Would you like me to give you a network diagnostic command list you can run to automatically verify your DNS, route, and connectivity (and fix them if broken)? That would make sure Git works without needing manual fixes next time.

You said:
(you can generate one from [GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)]).
what should i copy ? the name of the token ??
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question üí° ‚Äî no, you should copy the token value itself, not the name.

Here‚Äôs exactly what to do üëá

üîê Step-by-step: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
Go to:
üëâ https://github.com/settings/tokens

Click "Generate new token (classic)"

Give it a name, for example:

pqc-cert-upload
Under Expiration, choose something like 90 days or No expiration (for testing).

Under Select scopes, check:

‚úÖ repo (full control of private and public repositories)

‚úÖ workflow (optional but useful)

Click Generate token at the bottom.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important
GitHub will now show you your Personal Access Token (PAT) once only ‚Äî
it looks like this:

ghp_a1B2c3D4e5F6g7H8i9J0kLmNopQrS
üëâ Copy this entire token (not the name).

üíª Step 2: Use it in your terminal
In your terminal, set up Git credentials:

git config --global credential.helper store
Then push again:

git push -u origin main
When it asks for:

Username:
Password:
Enter:

Username: your GitHub username

Password: paste the token (instead of your GitHub password)

After that, it will store your credentials, and future git push or git pull will work automatically ‚úÖ

Would you like me to show you a secure way to permanently save the token (so it never asks again even after reboot)?

You said:

üí° Hybrid certificates allow negotiation of either RSA or PQC-based TLS depending on server support.

üîç Verification
To verify that the OQS provider is available:

export OPENSSL_MODULES=~/oqs-local/lib/ossl-modules
~/oqs-local/bin/openssl list -provider oqsprovider -public-key-algorithms
Expected output includes:

Kyber512
Kyber768
Kyber1024

Would you like me to include a short "Future Work" section (about client-server communication using these certificates)?
It would explain how you could extend this to secure browser-based communication.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

This project demonstrates how to generate **PQC**, **RSA**, and **Hybrid (RSA + PQC)** certificates using the **OQS provider** with a custom OpenSSL build.  
It also shows how to import these certificates into browsers and verify PQC algorithm support.

## üß© How It Works

1. **Environment Setup**
   - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` ‚Üí Points to the local liboqs installation.  
   - `OPENSSL_MODULES` ‚Üí Points to the directory containing `oqsprovider.so`.

2. **Custom OpenSSL Invocation**
   - Uses `$INSTALL_DIR/bin/openssl` (OQS-enabled build).  
   - Supports PQC key generation using the OQS provider.

3. **Certificate Generation**
   - **PQC (Kyber768)** ‚Äî via OQS provider  
   - **RSA (2048-bit)** ‚Äî via standard OpenSSL routines  
   - **Hybrid** ‚Äî combines RSA + PQC into one `.p12` file

4. **PKCS#12 Export**
   - Stores private key + certificate securely.  
   - Password-protected for browser/device installation.
